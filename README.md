# my-rancid-scripts
Rancid scripts I've modified when I couldn't find something already done

antrancid - reads the config from a LMX-1002G-SFP-T switch.  uses clogin.</br>
  supports the normal .cloginrc options
  
ant18login - specialized expect login script to deal with the LNX-1802GN-T switch</br>
ant18rancid - For the LNX-1802GN-T</br>
  These scripts don't handle unknown ssh keys. So connect to the switch once to record the key in known hosts
